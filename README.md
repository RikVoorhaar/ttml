# ttml
Tensor train based machine learning estimator.

Uses existing machine learning estimators to initialize a tensor train
decomposition on a particular feature space discretization. Then this tensor
train is further optimized with Riemannian conjugate gradient descent.

This library also implements much functionality related to tensor trains, and
Riemannian optimization of tensor trains. Finally there is some functionality
for turning decision trees and forests into CP/tensor trains.

# Installation

The `ttml` python package can be installed using `pip` by running
```
    pip install ttml
```
or by cloning this repository and running the following command in the root directory of this project:
```
    git clone git@github.com:RikVoorhaar/ttml.git
    pip install .
```

If you want to reproduce the experiments discussed in our paper, then first clone this repository. Then run
the script `datasets/download_datasets.py` to download all relevant datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Then all figures and results can be reproduced by the
scripts in the `notebooks` folder. To install all the dependencies for the scripts and tests, you can use the
`conda` environment defined in `environment.yml`.
